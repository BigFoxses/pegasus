### my personal notes about pegasus

----------------- using

Easy to add a new security group under "VPC" in the main AWS
dashboard (on lower left under "Networks")

Initially thought the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION could take a series of values

should emphasize that only need key name, not `~/.ssh/key_name.pem`.
It seems that it has to be stored in .ssh too?

for spot instances, it takes a few minutes.

cannot stop a spot instance! Action Item:  automate setting up spot instances
along with tehnologies in one script by wrapping both into one script

does pegasus support stoppint?  seems only terminating or uninstalling
technolobies

developing
--------------------------
all the main `peg` call options can be found in the beginning of peg: 

      echo "    - region"
      echo "    - fetch"
      echo "    - up"
      echo "    - down"
      echo "    - install"
...

In these cases are calls to functions in util.sh

---
spark_hadoop.sh is an example that starts instances and spins up a cluster 
with specified technologies. 

-- it runs `peg up` and then a bunch of `peg install` calls

Q:  once a cluster is up and running, how to stop and re-start the cluster. This basically automates 
the process of manually clicking stop and start all the time on the AWS dashboard
